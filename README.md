# PluGeN

This repository contains the official code for the paper [PluGeN: Multi-Label Conditional Generation From Pre-Trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09011) presented at AAAI 2022.

The code is divided into three directories containing code for three different types of experiments:
* `CharVAE/` – experiments on the ZINC 250k dataset using the CharVAE backbone.
* `StyleGAN/` – experiments on the FFHQ dataset using the StyleGAN backbone. 
* `VAE/` – experiments on the CelebA dataset using the VAE backbone
